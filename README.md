# Triple Triad Solver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jrstarke/triple-triad-solver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jrstarke/triple-triad-solver)

This project is a work in progress solver for a mid-game within a game I'm 
playing.

This project is built using Polymer and WebComponents, as an opportunity to to 
experiment with them.

For now, this project doesn't do anything useful, but it has interesting tests.
